What to do next?

- Fix the bug that KDE PDF should be plotted using **training data**.
- Try to plot KDE PDF curves for targets and non-targets sperately.
- Use more data (concatenate data from traning files together)
- Combine the classifier with the SS/DS algorithm, and see how the full-stack P300 BCI works.
