Things to do next:
1. sort by the y-axis
2. update the plot on [pp.6]
3. plot simulation (stopping-time/accuracy VS detextability index) and see if the actual experiment results (average # of flashes/accuracy) falls on it
4. investigate participant #5
5. try differnt paradigms and mix them (different training/testing pair)


## Final reports
1. intro
1. background
2. methods
3. results
4. discussion
