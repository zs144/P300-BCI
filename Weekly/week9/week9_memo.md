Things to do next:
1. - [x] sort by the y-axis
2. - [x] update the plot on [pp.6]
3. - [x] plot simulation (stopping-time/accuracy VS detextability index) and see if the actual experiment results (average # of flashes/accuracy) falls on it
4. - [x] investigate participant #5
5. - [ ] try differnt paradigms and mix them (different training/testing pair)
